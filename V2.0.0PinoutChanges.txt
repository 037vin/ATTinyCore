Changes to pinout images for ATTinyCore 2.0.0
* New ATTiny1634 pinout
* ATTiny1634 - VUSB pins: PC4 D+, PC5 D-
* ATTiny861 - VUSB pins: PB6 D+, PB4 D- (by not putting it on PD5, the third PWM pin is no longer encumbered by a the USB crap)
* ATTiny841,84 - VUSB pins: PB0, PB1. I may have to make both combinations an option because every conceivable arrangement of these has been used!
* ATTiny828 - PA4 SDA (master only mode), PA5 SDA (master-only mode). The 828 uses the same pins for SPI and hardware TWI slave. But if only using master mode (we have tools menu because I can't seem to get sane compile sizes any way other than switching which ones get built in based on menu option - otherwise it has to build every damned method and include them in the code, even when the slave ones never get called and aren't used.
